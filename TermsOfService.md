CleanCode Terms of Service
==========================

Any CleanCode products, files, applications, data or services provided to you (the "Client") can now be referred to as the "Services".

By using, downloading, installing, viewing the source code of, looking at, browsing the documentation for (including, but not limited to these Terms of Service), hearing about (misunderstandings, even when later found out to be unrelated to the Services, count as well), passing by, being connected to a Minecraft multiplayer server and/or shared single-player world with CleanCode source code and/or any Services content included anywhere in the world save folder or its subdirectories, pinging, tracing the web route to, being interested in, and/or thinking about the Services, you agree to the CleanCode Terms of Service, as defined by this document.

Your agreement to these Terms of Service (or simply "Terms") will be referred to as the "Condition".

## 1. Who Can Use the Services

No one under 0 years of age is allowed to create an account or use the Services. Additionally, nobody who already owns an account for the Services is allowed to create another account. Lost credentials and compromised accounts shall be resolved through the CleanCode Technical Support and/or a bloody vendetta and are thus outside the scope of these Terms.

CleanCode and its author(s) reserve the right to delete a Client's account at any time, even (and especially) without stating the purpose. By passing the Condition, Clients understand and accept that the Services shouldn't be used for long term data storage and therefore expect no compensation of any kind from CleanCode, the Services, CleanCode author(s), and/or author(s) of other parts of the Services if and when their account is deleted, and understand that "their" data (i.e. data collected from their user sessions or *thanks to* their user sessions) might never be recovered.

If you are using the Services on behalf of a business or some other entity, you state that you are authorized to grant all licenses set forth in these Terms and to agree to these Terms on behalf of the business or entity.

## 2. "Your" Content

Many of the Services let you create, upload, post, send, receive, and store content, and might do this automatically for various reasons. When you or they do that, you waive all ownership rights in that content.

But before waiving *your* ownership rights, you grant the author(s) of the Services a worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, create derivative works from, publicly perform, broadcast, distribute, syndicate, promote, exhibit, and publicly display that content in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed).

You also grant the Services' author(s) the unrestricted, worldwide, perpetual right and license to use, transfer, store, sublicense, and sell any and all data found or transfered through any and all devices you are using the Services on, even when this data contains private and/or personally identifiable information in any and all media and distribution channels (now known or later developed) and to link this information with any and all other data collected by other means.

*Then* you waive all ownership rights in that content mentioned above.

The Services author(s) may access, review, screen, and delete used-to-be-your content at any time and for any reason, including if we think said content violates these Terms. You alone though remain responsible for the content you create, post, store, send, or otherwise make available through the Services.

## 3. Privacy

The moment you fulfill the Condition is also the moment you waive all privacy rights. All Clients understand that privacy can *not* be ensured while using and/or interacting with the Services.

## 4. Honesty

The proper functioning of the Services can only be ensured as long as the Clients are honest in filling in forms and prompts presented by the Services. Lying (white lies *do* count), forgetting to mention important facts, whining about the quality of the Services, stating false or unclear information, not telling the whole story, being picky, and general dishonesty is a violation of these Terms and will be punished according to the applicable law or harder, if the need arises.

By fulfilling the Condition, you also state that you will report any and all Clients who violate these Terms, in order to protect the Services and ensure they  function properly. Not reporting users who (un)knowingly violate these Terms is itself a violation of these Terms. On the other hand, any reports have a chance of a cake prize.

## 5. Disclaimers

THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. IN ADDITION, WHILE THE CLEANCODE AUTHORS ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE A GOOD USER EXPERIENCE, THEY DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT: (A) THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS BE SECURE, ERROR-FREE, OR TIMELY; (B) THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS FUNCTION WITHOUT DELAYS, DISRUPTIONS, OR IMPERFECTIONS; OR (C) THAT ANY CLEANCODE CONTENT, USER CONTENT, OR INFORMATION YOU OBTAIN ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL BE TIMELY OR ACCURATE.

THE CLEANCODE AUTHORS TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY AND ASSUME NO LIABILITY FOR ANY CONTENT THAT YOU, ANOTHER USER, OR A THIRD PARTY CREATES, UPLOADS, POSTS, SENDS, RECEIVES, OR STORES ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU MAY BE EXPOSED TO CONTENT THAT MIGHT BE OFFENSIVE, ILLEGAL, MISLEADING, OR OTHERWISE INAPPROPRIATE, NONE OF WHICH THE CLEANCODE AUTHORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR.

## 6. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE CLEANCODE AUTHORS AND THEIR MANAGING MEMBERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, AND SUPPLIERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM: (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (B) THE CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES ON THE SERVICES; OR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR CONTENT OR POSTS, EVEN IF THE CLEANCODE AUTHORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL THE CLEANCODE AUTHORS' AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES EXCEED THE GREATER OF $1 USD OR HALF THE AMOUNT YOU PAID THE CLEANCODE AUTHORS, IF ANY, IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
